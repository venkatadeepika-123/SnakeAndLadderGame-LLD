# SnakeAndLadderGame-LLD

Problem Statement:

Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input (from the command line or a file):

--> Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a name.

--> Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.

--> Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.

After taking these inputs, you should print all the moves in the form of the current player name followed by a random number between 1 to 6 denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move. Format: <player_name> rolled a <dice_value> and moved from <initial_position> to <final_position>

When someone wins the game, print that the player won the game. Format: <player_name> wins the game
